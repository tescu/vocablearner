# dictgame

# THIS PROJECT IS WIP.

`dictgame` is a simple terminal program written in Lua that gives the user
a random word in a chosen language, and four possible translations.
The goal is to select the correct translation of the word. 3 mistakes result in
losing the game.

More game modes are planned.
